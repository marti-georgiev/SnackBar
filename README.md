## :pencil: Project Description
The proposed software aims to provide a user-friendly interface for both administrators and guests, allowing them to interact with the product inventory effectively. The system will enable administrators to manage the product catalog by adding new items, updating their details, and monitoring the available quantities. Additionally, administrators have the privilege to grant access to other administrators, ensuring proper management of the software.

On the other hand, guests will have a simplified view of the software, enabling them to browse through the product list, view details such as price and quantity, and reserve items for a limited time of 30 minutes. This feature allows guests to secure their desired products before making a purchase.

The software will support multiple devices, including computers and tablets, to cater to various user preferences and provide flexibility in accessing the application.

The main goals of this project are:

Develop a user-friendly software application for product visualization and reservation.
Implement a secure login system with distinct user roles (administrator and guest).
Provide administrators with the ability to manage the product catalog, including adding, updating, and modifying products and user access.
Enable guests to view product information, check availability, and reserve products for a limited time.
Ensure compatibility and responsiveness of the software on different devices, such as computers and tablets.
By creating this software, we aim to enhance the user experience and streamline the product management process, ultimately improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.
